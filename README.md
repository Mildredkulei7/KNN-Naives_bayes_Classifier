## Description
We are tasked to create a model that will classify if a mail is apam or not and also another model whch will tell if a passenger survived titanic or not. We are given different dataset for the two projects.

1.K nearest neighbours(KNN)
2.The Naives Bayes classifier

## Motivation
This project was done as part of an assessment for Data science core Machine learning course.
## Summary for analysis
* 1.Defining the question 
* 2.Importing the libraries 
* 3.Reading the data 
* 4.Data cleaning 
* 5.Exploratory data analysis(Biveriate summaries) 
* 6.Model creation 
* 7.Implementing solution 
* 8.Challenging solution
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Use google colab for data reparation and analysis.
* Import pandas, matplotlib, SEABORN, sklearn, and numpy lybraries.
## Known Bugs
